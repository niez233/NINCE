# NINCE
Improved Neural Interaction Networks Model for Cyberbullying Detection.

We propose Neural Interaction Networks by Comment Embedding (NINCE) model to address the missing positional and segment information in comment encoding. 

By focusing on these missing elements, we aim to enhance the model's ability to capture session distinctions and semantic nuances across sentences, improving representation learning in natural language processing tasks.
